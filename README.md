# Progressive Domain Training for Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)

## Summary

This project introduces a novel training strategy for **Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)** that aligns the optimization process with the **natural flow of physical information**. Instead of training the model over the full domain from the start, we propose a **progressive domain decomposition** approach, where the training region grows over time from boundary-constrained regions to the interior.
